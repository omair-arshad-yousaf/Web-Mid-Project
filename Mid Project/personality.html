    <p class="para">
        Our Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) was born in Makkah in the famous tribe of Quraish. His father, Abdullah died before his birth. So his mother, Amna Bibi looked after him. But she also died when he was only six years old. New, his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib took charge of him, but he did not live long. Finally, his uncle, Abu Talib looked after him and never left him alone in any hardship.
        <br><br>
Our Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) married Khadija, a wealthy lady of Makkah when he was twenty-five years old. Hazrat Khadija handed over all her wealth to our Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) to spend for good and noble purposes. He helped the poor and needy. When our Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) reached the age of forty he was commanded by Allah, the Almighty to preach Islam. Our Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) started preaching that there is no God but Allah who is the creator of the universe and to whom all human beings would return.
<br><br>
The people of Makkah accepted Islam very slowly. In the beginning, only a few people accepted the new religion. The Makkans indeed became the sworn enemy of the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) and his follower. They created all sort of troubles for the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) but he stood firm. At last, they planned to kill the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) and he was compelled to leave for Medina where he was accorded a warm welcome by his followers. But the infidels did not allow him to live even there in peace. They fought several battles in order to wipe out the followers of Islam. However, Allah granted strength to our Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) to defeat them and come out successful in his mission.
<br><br>
After ten years stay in Medinah, the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) came back to Makkah with ten thousand of his followers and conquered Makkah. On the day of his conquest, he could severely punish those who caused so much trouble and planned to kill him, but he excused everybody. After that, the new religion prospered by leaps and bounds.
Our Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) returned to his Creator at the age of sixty-three. He left for his followers the Holy Quran and the Sunnah.

          <p>Maulana Tariq Jameel is a prominent Deobandi scholar who is also one of the most popular preachers in Pakistan. He belongs to the Tablighi Jamaat group and his lectures focus on the subject of self-purification, avoidance of violence, observance of Allah’s orders and pursuing the way of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
            <br><br>
            Background: After completing pre-medical studies, Maulana Tariq was admitted to the King Edward Medical College in Lahore. It was there—under the influence of members of the Tablighi Jamaat—that his focus changed to Islamic Education. His Islamic training is from Jamia Arabia, where he studied Qur’an, Hadith, Sufism, logic, and Islamic jurisprudence. Maulana Tariq’s background in the sciences allows him to explain Islamic matters in a way that appeals to modern urban Muslims. 
            <br><br>
            Additionally, his simple lifestyle and eloquence in Urdu, as well as his fluency in Arabic, catapulted his fame across the Muslim world.
            Tablighi Jamaat: Tablighi Jamaat is a political missionary movement founded by Muhammad Ilyas Al-Kandhlawi in India in 1927. It focuses on encouraging Muslims not to neglect the basic practices of their faith. It has informal affiliations with the Deobandi movement but targets a more general audience. The sub-continent diaspora have carried its message to nearly every country in the world and its adherents number in the millions. It has annual gatherings in Pakistan and Bangladesh which number in the millions.
            <br><br>
            Influence: In addition to running a madrasa in Faisalabad, Pakistan, Maulana Tariq has delivered thousands of lectures around the world. He has been very effective in influencing all types of the community ranging from businessmen and landlords to ministers, actors, and sports celebrities.
